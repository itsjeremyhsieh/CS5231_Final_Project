However, it is essential to review the attached provenance graph (provenance_graph_all.png) for any anomalies that may warrant further investigation. Please remain vigilant and conduct a thorough analysis of the system environment to ensure ongoing integrity. Additionally, consider enhancing monitoring protocols to capture any emerging threats promptly."
