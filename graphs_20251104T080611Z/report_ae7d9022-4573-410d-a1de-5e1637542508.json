  "llm_summary": "The recent exploit detection report highlights critical security vulnerabilities within our systems, particularly a Command Injection vulnerability (5% match) and a Buffer Overflow Attempt (70% match), which poses a severe risk. The matched patterns for Command Injection include the use of \"nc,\" suggesting the potential for unauthorized remote access. The Buffer Overflow Attempt indicates attempts to manipulate memory allocation, which could lead to system crashes or allow malicious code execution. Immediate next steps should include a thorough analysis of the attached provenance graphs (buffer_overflow and all) to assess the extent of the vulnerabilities, promptly patch any exploited systems, and conduct a comprehensive security audit to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, it is imperative to implement stricter input validation and monitoring mechanisms to deter such attacks."
